# Jamboree-Education--Linear-Regression
**About**

Jamboree has helped thousands of students like you make it to top colleges abroad. Be it
GMAT, GRE or SAT, their unique problem-solving methods ensure maximum scores with
minimum effort. 

**Problem Statement**

Jamboree recently launched a feature where students/learners can come to their
website and check their probability of getting into the IVY league college. This feature estimates
the chances of graduate admission from an Indian perspective.

**Actionable Insights & Recommendations :**

1. The website has implemented a linear regression model or a feature allowing 
students/learners to assess their likelihood of gaining admission to an Ivy League 
college. This model yields an 81% accuracy rate in predicting admission 
probabilities.
2. This functionality serves to attract a broader audience of students/learners, 
providing Jamboree with valuable demographic insights for marketing purposes.
3. Utilizing this model, Jamboree can identify students/learners with lower admission 
probabilities and offer tailored coaching services to assist them in gaining admission
to their desired universities. This aspect holds significant value from a business 
standpoint.
4. A suggested enhancement for data collection involves incorporating an additional 
column for city or region names. This enhancement would facilitate targeting 
specific audience segments from those regions, allowing for tailored marketing 
strategies
